                            The type of yeast is what makes ales and lagers different, technically speaking. Lagers are made with strains that do their fermenting at cold temperatures. They sit at the bottom of the liquid while they work — that’s why lagers are also called bottom-fermented beers.

                            For drinkers, however, taste is the key distinction. Unlike ales, lagers tend to be crisp and dry, with a special ability to quench thirst. Here are some of the key players in this delicious arena.

                            Unlike lagers, ales are made with yeast strains that prefer to ferment in a warmer environment — closer to room temperature, actually. The yeast floats on the surface while it does its work, so ales are sometimes called top-fermented beers.

                            As for how these brews taste, we can’t really generalize. There are many strains of ale yeast that add all sorts of flavours, from fruity to earthy, so there’s a huge variety of options to explore in this world, including sweet brown ales and zesty pale wheat beers. Why not sample a range and see for yourself?

                            While these intensely dark beers are technically ales, they are often treated as a separate category. Fans of stouts and porters love their deep, roasty flavours of chocolate and coffee. They’re not very bitter, and they can be (but aren’t always) sweet. While many people associate them with wintery moods and foods, they’re also delicious during backyard grilling season.

                            Sometimes a beer category is not just about the yeast or malt. These terms are more about the flavourings added to lagers or ales.

                            <li>Fruit beer: Many fruits find their way into beer recipes — some popular ones are lime, strawberry and cherry. Most fruit beers are sweet, as you might imagine, and make a fine accompaniment for dessert.</li>
                            <li>Radler: A radler is part beer, part citrus juice and all refreshing. The word radler means “cyclist” in German, because legend has it that these mixtures were originally invented to quench the thirst of people who had just enjoyed a bike ride (though we can recommend plenty of other ways to get in the mood for one of these tangy drinks). A shandy is also a mix of beer and refreshing fruit juice, often lemon.</li>
                            <li>Honey beer: These copper-coloured brews have a creamy mouth feel and caramel-like flavours. Beer that gets a little help from bees can be sweet, as you might expect, but the effect is usually subtle — try one, and you might be surprised.</li>
